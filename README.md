# AptFindr

AptFindr is a Progressive Web Application for discovering and managing apartment listings in La Paz, Iloilo City. It provides separate Tenant, Landlord, and Admin workflows backed by Supabase.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide the project-specific public Supabase values.
3. Start development with `npm run dev`.

Never commit `.env`, service-role keys, passwords, or other secrets.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start the Vite development server
- `npm run typecheck` — run TypeScript checks
- `npm run lint` — run strict TypeScript unused-code checks
- `npm run build` — create the production build
- `npm run migrate:supabase -- <folder>` — import supported local JSON data using the database utility script

## Project map

- `src/App.jsx` — public, authentication, tenant, landlord, and admin routes
- `src/landing` and `src/auth` — public pages and shared authentication
- `src/tenant`, `src/landlord`, `src/admin` — flat role folders containing pages and their components
- `src/components` — shared controls, layouts, and account settings; `ui` contains the common UI primitives
- `src/services` — Supabase client and existing data-access services
- `src/contexts`, `src/hooks`, `src/data`, `src/utils` — shared state, data types, and helpers
- `src/assets` — images; `src/tools` — the existing design-guide and flowchart pages
- `src/styles` — global variables, base styles, shared sidebar styles, and the ordered stylesheet imports

Page-specific CSS lives beside its page or section. Landing and authentication now use semantic classes and plain CSS. Authentication shares one `AuthField` and common styles in `src/auth/auth.css`; its larger pages have adjacent stylesheets. The role pages and shared controls still need their Tailwind-to-CSS pass.

See [the tenant source guide](docs/TENANT_STRUCTURE.md) for tenant page locations, shared dependencies, cleanup details, and verification commands.

## Supabase

The local `supabase-master-migration.sql` is intentionally ignored and must not be committed. Run the current migration manually in the Supabase SQL Editor when required. Configure production Site URL, allowed `/auth/callback` and `/reset-password` redirects, and custom SMTP in Supabase.
